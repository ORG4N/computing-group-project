We've been working with EcoBadge to create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) website for their business.

# Frontend

The EcoBadge website is intended for customers looking to order food and support businesses in their local area that are actively trying to reduce their environmental impact and improve thier local communities.

### Website Pages

# Backend

In collaboration with the website, the Backend provides a database that stores data about local food eateries and businesses, and a API that presents that information to the Frontend.

### API

- The API gets information from the database, and sends it to the frontend where it is shown to the user.

### Database

- The database holds data related to a Business's profile, menu, ranking, and other details used in the website.
