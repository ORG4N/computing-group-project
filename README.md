This is Team A's github repo for the COMP2003 Computing Group Project.

We've been working with EcoBadge to create a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) website for their business.

# Frontend

The EcoBadge website is intended for customers looking to order food and support businesses in their local area that are actively trying to reduce their environmental impact and improve thier local communities.

### Website

- Home page: The websites main page, which goes into detail on what EcoBadge is and shows the EcoBadge tiers.
- About Us page: A page where members of the EcoBadge team are shown with information on EcoBadge's journey and future plans.
- Login page: The websites login, users/businesses can login or sign up by picking an account type and credentials.

### Directory

- Displays business's information (postcode, phone number, company name etc.) to the user. These can be filtered for businesses that are vegan friendly, or don't use single use plastic for exmaple.

- Clicking on a row in the Directory will show the user a business profile, where the businesses menu, EcoBadge tier and other information about the business can be found.

# Backend

In collaboration with the website, the Backend provides a database that stores data about local food eateries and businesses, and a API that presents that information to the Frontend.

### API

- The API gets information from the database and sends it to the frontend where it is shown to the user.

### Database

- The database holds data related to a business's profile, menu, ranking, and other important business details.
